There are n piles of stones placed around a playground. The stones are now combined into one pile in an orderly manner. It is stipulated that each time at least 2 piles and at most k piles of stones are selected and merged into a new pile. The cost of the combination is the number of stones in the new pile. Try to design an algorithm to calculate the maximum total cost and minimum total cost of combining n piles of stones into one pile. algorithm design For a given n piles of stones, calculate the maximum total cost and the minimum total cost combined into one pile. Subject requirements The input data is provided by the file input.txt. Output the calculated maximum total cost and minimum total cost to the file output.txt
